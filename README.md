# osvr-device-descriptor-editor

> Browser-based editor for OSVR device descriptor JSON..

## Build instructions
You need `npm`, `grunt-cli`, and `bower` installed globally. I think. Get `npm` with your package system, then this should get the rest:

```bash
npm i -g grunt-cli
npm i -g bower
```

Add `sudo` as needed.

To build this web site:

```bash
npm i && grunt
```

Output ends up in `dist`.

You can serve it locally with

```bash
grunt server
```
